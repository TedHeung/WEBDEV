                <p class="w3-medium">Eriin Gurvan Naadam, also known as Naadam, is a traditional Mongolian festival. The name translates to "Three Games of Men", and it is also referred to as "The Three Manly Sports". These games are the main components of the annual national festival in Mongolia, which takes place July 11-13 in the capital city, in Ulaanbaatar’s National Stadium. The three games or sports are: Horse racing, Wrestling and Archery.</p>
                <p class="w3-medium">It wasn’t until 1921 that Naadam was officially declared an annual national holiday in Mongolia.</p>
                <p class="w3-medium">For hundreds of years though, this trio of events – <a href="wrestling.html">wrestling</a>, <a href="anchery.html">archery</a> and <a href="horseracing.html">horse racing</a> – was believed to have been integral to building important skills for the region’s nomads as well as Mongolian soldiers.</p>
                <p class="w3-medium">According to some historical accounts, in the early 13th century, after Genghis Khan defeated his enemies and ruled over the Mongol tribes, he held the games as a celebratory event.</p>
                <p class="w3-medium">Providing evidence of this, the Stele of Genghis Khan – a stone dating back to the 1200s bearing the first known Mongolian script – depicted a nobleman named Yesunge who managed to shoot a target with an arrow from a distance of more than 500 meters.</p>

                <p class="w3-medium">These games were held every three years during the Qing times and were accompanied by a Tibetan Buddhist ritual. The festival has a long history, with modern researchers suggesting that Naadam originated from the Khuns (I - II B.C.). In 2010, Naadam was enlisted in the UNESCO world heritage list. It's a significant event that showcases Mongolian culture, tradition, and sportsmanship.</p>
