                <p class="w3-medium">Mongolian Archery is a traditional Mongolian sport that has been passed down through the generations. It is said to be one of the oldest sports in the world, and is still practiced today. Mongolian archery is unique in its use of horseback riding and bow hunting.</p>
                <p class="w3-medium">The sport is also known for its extreme accuracy, as traditional Mongolian archers are able to hit targets from great distances. Traditional Mongolian archery is a popular sport in Mongolia, and is often used as a way to show off one’s skills.</p>
                <p class="w3-medium">Archery wasn’t just a primary component of our ancient culture–it was everything. For nomadic tribes, archery was used as the main tool for hunting animals for food and protection from external threats.</p>
                <p class="w3-medium">From early on, Mongolian elders taught children how to use bows, and it became one of the main tools our ancestors relied on for centuries.</p>

                <p class="w3-medium">In the present day, Mongolians participate in archery matches to see who is the greatest marksman. Archery tournaments are divided into age groups. When children are aged 2 or 3, they start shooting.This year, a 78-year-old man was crowned the oldest Mongol archer, while a three-year-old boy took home the title of youngest archer. Archers claim that there are no age restrictions when it comes to archery; you can shoot as long as your strength allows it.</p>
                <p class="w3-medium">In Mongolia, around 20-30 archery competitions are organised each year, including a national championship.The biggest event is the Naadam festival which features three main traditional sports: Archery, wrestling and horse racing. These games have been deeply ingrained in Mongolian culture for many centuries.</p>
